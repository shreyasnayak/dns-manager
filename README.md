**DNS Manager** is a simple command-line tool that helps users manage DNS records for their domain names. It streamlines the process of adding, updating, or deleting DNS records without needing to navigate complex registrar interfaces.

## ðŸš€ Why DNS Manager?

This tool was inspired by a common pain point when using services like AWS EC2. When an EC2 instance is stopped and restarted, its public IP changesâ€”requiring manual DNS updates. DNS Manager automates this task, saving time and effort.

---

## ðŸ¤” Why not just use cURL, Python, or another language?

While itâ€™s possible to script these operations using existing tools, the ultimate goal of DNS Manager is to provide a secure and user-friendly experience. This includes:

- Safely storing API keys and secrets using encryption.
- Automatically decrypting and using them when needed.
- Building a dedicated CLI for clean, repeatable operations.

This project is just the beginningâ€”expect more security and automation features in future releases.

Here are some common commands:

```bash
# Get the local IP address
dnsmanager --get-ip local

dnsmanager --get-ip public

# Get the current IP address associated with a DNS record
dnsmanager --get-dns-ip --domain www.example.com
